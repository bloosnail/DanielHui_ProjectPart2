						<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, where I will be graduating this Spring (2017) with a B.S. in Computer Science with Honors. I have been working in the lab of <a href=http://www.pitt.edu/~wec47>Dr. Wei Chen</a>, which focuses on statistical genetics and computational genomics, for the past three years. Most of my work there has been with the design, implementation, and troubleshooting of analysis pipelines for next-generation sequencing data, as well as the creation of related visualizations and web-based tools. I am currently looking for post-graduate opportunities within related bioinformatics work.</p>

								<h3>Sequence Analysis</h3>
								<p align="left">I was responsible for the design and implementation of sequencing analysis pipelines for ATAC-seq for differential expression, and whole-genome metagenomics for study of the eye's microbiome. I am also experienced with analysis for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, 16S rRNA sequencing, and Hi-C data. Areas of analysis that I would be especially interested in learning more about and working with are single-cell sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, cancer, de novo assembly, the microbiome, and third-generation sequencing platforms.</p>

								<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
								<p align="left">I am only now starting to formally learn about machine learning and statistical analysis, as related courses were out of reach earlier on. So far, most of my work has been more on the -omics side, and I have been meaning to branch out into more statistical downstream analyses. Specifically, I would be interested in applying machine learning techniques to large high-dimensional datasets (eg. single-cell datasets, CRISPR gene-knockout data), where algorithms for clustering and dimensionality reduction are especially used. </p>

								<h3>Algorithm Development</h3>
								<p align="left">A significant portion of my upper-level coursework has been related to the design and analysis of algorithms, and usage of efficient data structures. I would be very interested in learning more about specific algorithms and data structures that are especially common in bioinformatics eg. suffix trees/tries, de Bruijn graphs, Burrows-Wheeler transform, etc. Additionally, I have not really gotten the chance yet to train my algorithmic skills in a real project, and would be very open to a related opportunity.</p>
