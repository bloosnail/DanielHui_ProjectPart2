-I used a template from HTML5UP (https://html5up.net/arcana)
-I uploaded the original main.css then copy-pasted my edited version in, so the changes can be seen through 'History'
	-did the same for all .html files
-The main JavaScript element is the 'Fake Contact Form' under Contact
	-the non-framework JavaScript code I used is in email-validation.js
-I used tabs instead of 2-spaces for indentation

-I plan on using a variation of this website for actual usage, so the information there is true


Planned updates:
-add a favicon
-use include file using PHP for the footer
-have the email form actually work
-add a 'Projects' tab
